## Usage

Install the plugin:

 ```bash
 npm install --save-dev typescript-yaml-plugin
 ```

Update your tsconfig.json:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [{ "name": "typescript-yaml-plugin" }]
  }
}
```

Start importing YAML files! ðŸŽ‰

```ts
import schema from './schema.yaml';
```

### VSCode Users

Make sure your editor is using the workspace version of TypeScript (the one where the plugin is installed). To do this:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version`
3. Choose `Use Workspace Version`

## Notes

- This plugin uses the [`yaml`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml) package under the hood. Supported features and limitations are fully inherited from that library.
- This plugin is **only for editor support** (autocomplete and type-checking). It does **not** make `.yaml` files work at runtime. To actually be able to import YAML files in your running code, youâ€™ll need to pair this with a runtime plugin that handles `.yaml` files like [`bun-plugin-yaml`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bun-plugin-yaml)
or [`@modyfi/vite-plugin-yaml`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modyfi/vite-plugin-yaml), depending on your runtime.
- This plugin was inspired by [`typescript-plugin-yaml`](https://github.com/await-ovo/typescript-plugin-yaml), which is no longer maintained and does not support TypeScript 5+.
